<h1>Old Fashioned Spaghetti</h1>

<p> It seems like everyone I have ever met has “a spaghetti recipe” they know and love, and each one is different! Some have store-bought sauce, some homemade. Some have meat, some have veggies, and others don’t.

    It just surprises me that they are all different, but I love that everyone has their own twist on this classic dinner recipe.
    
    We too have a favorite Spaghetti recipe we’ve made for years and love. That’s probably why we make this Spaghetti for dinner so often (we also have a great Baked Spaghetti and Chicken Spaghetti)!
    
    It’s simple, easy to make, always tastes delicious, and everyone likes it. And honestly, leftovers taste exactly the same heated up as if it was just made (my kind of leftover)!!
    
    Whenever I make this Easy Spaghetti Recipe, I usually serve it with some Cheesy Garlic Bread and a side of Fried Zucchini, for one delicious meal!
