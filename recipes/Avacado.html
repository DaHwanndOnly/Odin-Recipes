    Avocado toast is pretty divisive: You either can’t get enough of it, or you’re totally sick of hearing about it. With a plethora of avocado toast recipes out there—some simple, others more complex—it’s easy to wonder if we’ve reached peak avocado.

    But before you write off this open-faced Instagrammable marvel, let’s remember why we love avocado toast in the first place. Mashed avocado spread over crusty whole-wheat bread, finished with olive oil, red pepper flakes, and flaky sea salt—does it get much better than that?  It’s full of healthy, unsaturated fats, packed with fiber, and it’s an effortless breakfast or snack.

    So forget fancy-pants versions topped with lobster, truffles, and gold flakes—or spinoffs like avocado art, avocado roses, and avocado toast chocolate bars. You need a perfect avocado toast recipe that’s 100% no-nonsense.

    Look no further. This is the easiest—and the last—avocado toast recipe you’ll ever need to know. Memorize the recipe, then use it as a jumping off point for your favorite avocado toast riffs. Put an egg on it, top it with tuna salad, or crown it with fluffy alfalfa sprouts for a healthy and satisfying meal. You can mix up the toppings too—we love Japanese furikake or everything bagel seasoning.
